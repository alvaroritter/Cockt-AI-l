# Cockt-AI-l
An autonomous cocktail mixing system, as a project for the TUM module Embedded Systems.

## The Idea
Our goal is to create a system that automatically mixes a desired drink with the correct amount of each ingredient. Our system will be composed of two main parts, each controlled by a microcontroller:
- A bottle storage, including the necessary mechanisms to open and close the bottle again after a specified amount of time
- A motorized glass transportation system, which will move back and forth underneath the bottles



## The Components
- Arduino UNO, controls bottles
- Arduino Nano, controls glass movement
- MG 996R servo motors, one for each bottle
- 2x HC-05 Bluetooth modules
